jecharacters.gui.calculator.help=Welcome to the main interface of the mod. The first thing suggested to do is to use the two buttons in the upper right to input the recipes, which allows you to create and edit recipes. All of the calculations require recipes to be recorded.\fTo calculate the cost of an item, simply pick the item from JEIs item list then put it in the slot in the upper left of the interface with all of the recipes to use recorded. The result will then be displayed in the lower slots of the interface. The four buttons provide options to display input, output, catalyst and crafting steps.\fThe button in the upper left allows you to edit and get a label. Labels are a very important part of the mod. They are basically things that can be put into a slot, including ItemStack, FluidStack, OreDict entry, or simply a placeholder. Lables are used in the calculation process. Most of time they are quite clever as long as you configure them properly.

In addition, you can use mouse scroll to quickly change the amount. Clicking the "Clear" button will remove all of the labels.\fUsing recipe fast transfer, some labels will automatically setup for you, like oreDict labels. If you do not want this behavoir, simply use "Disambiguous" button to select manually. You can also add labels by ckicking the "Add label" button. By the way, normally you shouldn't put fuzzy labels as output.\fYou can easily manage recipes using groups. Click the "New group" button, type the group name and hit the tick, you are done. The new group name will show in the top bar. If you already have groups set up and you want to use an existing one, you can use the arrows to select between them.\fWhen you are editing an existing recipe, you will have two extra buttons, "Save as" and "Delete". "Save as" allows you to save the current recipe as a new recipe, without changing the existing one. "Delete" simply allows you to delete the recipe.
